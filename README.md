# React Boilerplate

The master branch has boilerplate for a simple react application. Webpack has been configured to work with sass, and a number of other misc files in addition to the default js/css.

## Redux

React often comes hand in hand with redux; but some projects don't necessarily need it. React+Redux Boilerplate can be found in the redux branch of this repo.
